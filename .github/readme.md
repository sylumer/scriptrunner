# Script Runner

## Description
Script Runner is a Mac utility app that is intended to allow you to run scripts without opening a terminal session.

Standard options for execution involve terminal sessions:

- If you set a script file's executable bit (e.g. `chmod +x myscript.sh`), you can execute it from a terminal.
- If you rename such a script to a `.command` file (or even remove the file extension), opening it from Finder will execute the script in a terminal window.

With Script Runner installed, you can rename your script to have a `.shx` (*shell-executable*) or `.rsh` (*run-shell*) file extension. When such a file is opened, Script Runner will execute the script instructions it contains, but it will do so in the background - without a terminal window being displayed.
